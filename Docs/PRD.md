## Success Metrics

- **Innovation**: Industry-leading interactive features

## Development Approach

- **Documentation**: Comprehensive inline and external documentation

## Constraints & Considerations

- Target the latest stable version of Google Chrome.
- Aggressively leverage modern, Chrome-specific APIs and CSS features without any fallbacks, polyfills, or vendor prefixes.
- Do not worry about semantic HTML.
- Do not worry about accessibility principles, including ARIA attributes, semantic tags, and keyboard navigation.
- The experience is purely visual and mouse-driven.
- Assume the environment is always enabled and flawless; no progressive enhancement is required.
