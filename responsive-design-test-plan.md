- Large desktop: 1280px+

## Test Devices

Test the website on the following devices or screen sizes:

### Mobile Devices

- iPhone SE (375px width)
- iPhone 12/13 (390px width)
- iPhone 12/13 Pro Max (428px width)
- Google Pixel 6 (393px width)
- Samsung Galaxy S21 (360px width)

### Tablets

- iPad Mini (768px width)

- Samsung Galaxy Tab (800px width)

### Laptops/Desktops

- Small laptop (1024px width)
- Standard laptop (1366px width)
- Large desktop (1920px width)
- Ultra-wide monitor (2560px width)

## Test Browsers

Test on the following browsers:

- Chrome
- Safari

- Verify that the menu opens and closes correctly on mobile
- Verify that all navigation links are easily tappable on mobile (minimum 44x44px touch target)

### 2. Layout

- Verify that the layout adjusts appropriately at each breakpoint
- Verify that there is no horizontal scrolling on any device
- Verify that content is properly centered and aligned at all screen sizes
- Verify that the HeroSection component adapts correctly to different screen sizes
- Verify that the DataTags display correctly (as a horizontal list on mobile, positioned absolutely on desktop)

### 3. Typography

- Verify that images don't overflow their containers
- Verify that images load quickly on mobile devices

### 5. Touch Interactions

- Verify that all interactive elements have appropriate touch targets
- Verify that hover effects work on desktop and have touch equivalents on mobile
- Verify that the synthesize button is easily tappable on mobile
- Verify that DataTags respond to touch interactions

### 6. Performance

- Verify that animations run smoothly on mobile devices
- Verify that the website loads quickly on mobile connections
- Verify that the particle background doesn't cause performance issues on mobile

## Testing Tools

- Chrome DevTools Device Mode
- Browser Stack or similar cross-browser testing tool
- Physical devices when available
- Lighthouse for performance testing

## Documentation

For each test scenario, document:

- Device/screen size
- Browser
- Orientation
- Pass/fail status
- Screenshots of any issues
- Notes on any unexpected behavior

## Acceptance Criteria

The responsive design is considered successful when:

1. All content is accessible and usable on all tested devices
2. No horizontal scrolling is required
3. Text is readable without zooming
4. Interactive elements are easily tappable on touch devices
5. The layout is visually appealing at all breakpoints
6. Performance is acceptable on mobile devices
